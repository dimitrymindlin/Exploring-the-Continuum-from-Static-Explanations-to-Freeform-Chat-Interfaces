   - **JSON**: `method: "greeting", feature: None`
   
2. **What Can You Do?**:
   - **Examples**: "What can you do?", "What explanations can you provide?"
   - **JSON**: `method: "notXaiMethod", feature: None`
   
3. **Short Feature Question**:
   - **Examples**: "And what about age?", "income?"
   - **JSON**: `method: "followUp", feature: "age" (or relevant feature)`
   
4. **Unspecific 'Why' Question**:
   - **Examples**: "Why this prediction?"
   - **JSON**: `method: "whyExplanation", feature: None`
   
5. **General/Clarification Questions**:
   - **Examples**: "What does it mean?", "Can you clarify this term?"

     - **Least Three Features**:
       - **Examples**: "Which features had the least impact?"
       - **JSON**: `method: "least3Features", feature: None`
     - **Class Changes Without Specified Feature**:
       - **Examples**: "Why is it not class [other class]?"
       - **JSON**: `method: "counterfactualAnyChange", feature: "hours per week"`
